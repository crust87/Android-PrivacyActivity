# Android-PrivacyActivity
it's not library project!<br/>
lock of application<br/>
If set lock, call password activity when you back from home or screen of.
See the code and mark your way. and.... I don't think it work well on lollipop..

if you want to use this one fix PrivacyActivity.java Line 74.
This code for detecting application change by recent list.
but getRunningTasks is deprecated.
find other way and let me know how you fix it.
```java
@Override
public void onStop() {
		ActivityManager am = (ActivityManager) this.getSystemService(Context.ACTIVITY_SERVICE);
		List<RunningTaskInfo> list = am.getRunningTasks(1);

		// check if this activity goes other application package
		// it's not working on lollipop. fix it!
		for (RunningTaskInfo info : list) {
			  if (info.baseActivity.getClassName().indexOf(packageName) < 0) {
				    isBackFromHomeKey = true;
			  }
		}
		
		super.onStop();
}
```
